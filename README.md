# Description
This ML project aims at using Linear Regression model to predict the life expectancy of a country based on the value of adult mortality, infant deaths, GDP, HIV/AIDS, Diphtheria patients, schooling, income composition of resources, and the economic status of that country(developing or developed). Using the model, I was able to predict correctly 85% of the testing data. Unlike the first regression project, I encountered a problem for this project: missing datas for five features. As a result, I had to manipulate and clean the data by imputing the missing values with the means and medians.
